## Stuff to Learn Node.js
---

### 1. Description

This repository compiles a few exercises and tutorials I have made from some Edx courses on Node.js.

### 2. Details

Each sub-directory is a distinct and self-contained exercise with its own `package.json` file for dependencies management.

The exercises cover basics asynchronous IOs, rest API, mongoDB (including schema) and sqlite.
